# Network Infrastructure Project

This project involved designing and configuring the network infrastructure for the SRWE Company. The goal was to upgrade their existing network to support new features and redundancy requirements.

# Overview

* Configured and cabled new routers, switches, wireless LAN controller and access points
* Established layer 2 and layer 3 connectivity throughout topology
* Implemented VLANs, trunking, SVIs to segment and route traffic
* Configured spanning tree, etherchannel for redundancy and bandwidth
* Setup HSRP to provide gateway redundancy for hosts
* Configured NAT on firewall for private to public IP translation
* Established dynamic routing with EIGRP and passive interfaces
* Implemented DHCP services for wired and wireless host addressing
* Configured CAPWAP controller-based wireless network
* Created SSIDs, WLANs, and AP groups to segment wireless traffic

# Network Devices Configured

* Routers:
  * Cisco 4331 ISR routers for WAN/LAN routing
  * Integrated routing modules and WIC cards
* Switches
  * Cisco Catalyst 3650 switches for distribution layer
  * Cisco Catalyst 2960 and 3560 switches for access layer
* Security/Access Control:
  * Cisco ASA firewall for NAT, ACLs
* Wireless Infrastructure:
  * Cisco 3504 wireless LAN controller
  * Cisco lightweight access points

# Key Configurations

* Hostname, MOTD banners, management protocols, and passwords set on all devices
* Layer 2 switchports, VLANs for segmentation, inter-switch trunking
* Layer 3 interfaces, static and dynamic routing, FHRP for redundancy
* NAT overload using ACLs to translate private to public IP addresses
* DHCP pools on switches to provide addressing for wired/wireless hosts
* Lightweight APs adopted by WLC using CAPWAP discovery and tunneling
* WLANs, SSIDs and AP groups configured on controller for wireless access

# Skills Demonstrated

* Proficiency in Cisco IOS and wireless LAN controller GUIs
* Layer 2 switching concepts - access ports, VLANs, trunking, etherchannel
* Layer 3 routing configuration - static routes, dynamic routing protocols
* Redundancy protocols - STP, HSRP, FHRP concepts and configuration
* Wireless networking - CAPWAP, WLC, LWAP adoption and management
* Security fundamentals - ACLs, firewall rules, NAT, password management
This unified network project allowed me to apply and demonstrate skills in routing, switching, wireless connectivity, and network security fundamentals. The project helped cement knowledge gained through hands-on Cisco training and certification courses.
